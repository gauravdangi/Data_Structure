## Invert Binary Tree

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

In-order traversing: 12 16 20 25 32 35 40

Pre-order traversing: 32 20 12 16 25 35 40

Post-order traversing: 16 12 25 20 40 35 32

Height of tree: 3
